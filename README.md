### Additional Thanks
I would like to extend special thanks to the Youtube channel "Traversy Media" that helped me to gain a better grasp of CSS functionality. 

Note: I spent so much time working on it and making personal breakthroughs that I forgot to add commits. This to be remedied on future projects. -Tyler.
